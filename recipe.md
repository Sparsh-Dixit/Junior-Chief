1- To a strainer, add flattened rice (poha). Rinse it under running water until it turns soft.

2- To check if itâ€™s done, press a flake between your thumb and index finger, it should break easily.

3- Add turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the poha and toss to combine. Set it aside while you make the tempering in the pan.

4- Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop.

5- Then add the peanuts and saute for a minute or two until they start turning brown.

6- Then add the chopped onion, green chili and curry leaves. Cook for 2 minutes until the onions soften.

7- Add the green peas (which had been soaked in warm water for 10 minutes prior) and mix. Cook for 2 minutes until raw smell of peas goes away.

8- Then add in the rinsed poha and toss to combine. Taste test some poha and if it feels dry, sprinkle little water all over (I usually do that). Cook for 1-2 minutes.  Also tastes test and add more salt as needed at this point (I added around 1/8 teaspoon).

9- Also add the sugar (if using) and cilantro.

10- And then cover the pan with a lid and turn heat to low. Let it be like that for 2 minutes. Then turn off the heat.

11- Squeeze in some fresh lemon juice. Garnish poha with more cilantro and sev and serve with a cuppa chai.
